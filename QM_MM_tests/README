reference benchmarks were run with unmodified psi4, installed by conda in RHEL7 environment on gemini-cpu cluster.  psi4 version is:
psi4                      1.3.2+ecbda83    py37h31b3128_0    psi4

these benchmarks incorporate analytic QM/MM interactions from embedded MM point charges


Summary of Tests:

1) RKS_test_He_5Qfield_quadrature_only: 
   this is a direct test of the Psi4 quadrature implementation of the external MM field for a He ion in a 5 ion field.
   the MMsystem is input to Psi4, and the MMfield is evaluated directly at every point on the quadrature grid.
   this is a test of the quadrature implementation in the one-electron potential contribution to the Hamiltonian/Kohn-Sham matrix

   a collection of tests for different angular/radial quadrature settings can be run with the run_tests.sh script


2) RKS_test_He_5Qfield_PMEgrid_cutoff:
   This is the same system as 1), but now the MM field is computed (in part) using a PME sum, evaluated on the PME grid by OpenMM,
   input to Psi4, and interpolated onto the DFT-quadrature grid.  Thus the difference between 1) and 2) tests both the evaluation
   of the external potential on the PME grid using OpenMM, as well as interpolation accuracy from the PME to quadrature grid.

   Note that interpolation from PME-to-DFT grid is inaccurate for short-range interactions.  Thus we use a hybrid scheme, where short-range
   interactions are implemented analytically in Psi4, and only MM interactions beyond a cutoff are computed with OpenMM/PME.
   The current test-case incorporates the 3 closest ions analytically (in Psi4), and the two farthest ions are incorporated by the OpenMM computed external potential

   a collection of tests for different PMEgrid/cutoff and angular/radial quadrature settings can be run with the run_tests.sh script

3) RKS_test_h2o_5Qfield:
   similar to 2) but now a water molecule is in the ion field.  Demonstrates that good agreement can be achieved with purely numerical/PME external potential and no analytic embedding,
   using very large PME grid=375

4) UKS_test_Li_5Qfield:
   This is similar to test 2), but for open-shell Li atom.  The ion field is the same, and the closest 3 ions are treated analytically, and the two farthest are incorporated
   by the OpenMM computed external potential.  This tests the quadrature implementation in the Unrestricted-Kohn Sham code


5) PME_test_ion_pair_QMregion_exclude:
   This is a direct test of the evaluation of the external potential on the PME grid by OpenMM.  This example is for a box with two Li-I ion pairs,
   and prints out the external potential on the PME grid evaluated with the full PME sum compared to a direct "real-space" evaluation of the potential on the grid

6) PME_test_water_droplet
   Similar to 5), this is a direct test of the evaluation of the external potential on the PME grid for a ~1nm water droplet.  Note that the box lengths are very large,
   to minimize contribution of water droplet images (which aren't considered in the reference benchmark).  Also the cutoff is large enough that all water molecules should
   be including in computing real-space Ewald corrections, so that potential is accurate at all grid points.

7) test_bulk_water
   this is a test of one water QM in bulk water MM.  Two calculations are conducted, first with no analytic MM embedding, and second with 3 water molecules included in analytic embedding.
   There is good agreement between the calculations when a large PME grid=425 is used.  A third calculation tests a different interpolation scheme (projecting on the PME grid instead of real-space projection),
   which should exhibit perfect agreement with the first calculation

8) test_water_droplet_orthorhombic_box
   this is a similar system to 6), but tests a water droplet in both a cubic box as well as an orthorhombic (hexagonal) box.  The point is to check the PME calculation/interpolation scheme
   for non-cubic, non-rectangular simulation boxes. The new interpolation method (projecting to PME grid) is general to non-orthorhombic boxes, and there is good agreement between the calculations
   when a sufficiently large PME grid=500 is used.  Note that the box sizes have been increased somewhat to make the systems more similar, since the periodicity is slightly different with the 
   different box geometries
