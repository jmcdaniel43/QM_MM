#*************************** README  **************************************
#  This library defines classes that are used in a QM/MM simulation
#  Interfacing Psi4 and OpenMM
#
#  Because these codes use different units and datastructures, conversions
#  between these are done within the QM/MM classes, so that input and output
#  passed to/from the classes is given in units/datastructures of the
#  particular libraries (Psi4, OpenMM) that it comes from/goes to. 
#
#  for QM/MM/Ewald, must use custom Psi4/OpenMM source codes found here:
#     OpenMM: https://github.com/jmcdaniel43/openmm
#     Psi4: https://github.com/jmcdaniel43/psi4
