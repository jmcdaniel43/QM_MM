NOTE:
   The initial SCF iteration won't exactly agree between the test and reference calculations because the
   initial guess is based on the one-electron (core) Hamiltonian, and doesn't contain the DFT potential/quadrature contribution,
   which is where the MMfield is implemented in the test case.

   We compare the energetics after the SCF has converged, which should be the same
